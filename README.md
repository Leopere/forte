## Submitting a server
> If you would like to submit a server to this list, please open a pull request with a new file in the root directory. The file should be named `<hostname>.json` and should contain the following fields:

* `address`: The address of the server, which should be publicly accessible.
* `owner`: GitHub username of the server owner.

> Hostnames should be all lowercase and should not contain any special characters or spaces. Every server should have a unique hostname.

> Each user can only have one server on this list. If you would like to add another server, please remove the old one first.

> If you would like to update your server's information, please open a pull request with the updated information. 

Here's an example:

**forte.json**
```
{
    "address": "https://example.com",
    "owner": "kaangiray26"
}
```
